musts: 
1) must be mobile
2) deliver packages (shipments) safely
3) move within the road speed limits

wants : 
1) secure the shipment (anti-theif)  -> lock the box 
2) acceptable design  -> not just a punch of wires & wheels
3) eco-friendly
4) app? -> it is just a want
###Assumption :
1) the university network covers the whole campus or at least a 4G connection is avalible 
2) assumes no lock-down or any action can prevent us from coming to uni
3) assumes no temporary change on roads/streets exits/entries
###Constrains: 
1) the battery life should be enough at least for a back and fourth trip
2) the solution should not open or miss with the shipments
3) should not create trafic on the operating medium ( either on ground "مايسوي زحمة") or (on air "drones زحمة")
Objectives : 
Low:
1) save the staff time 
2) improve the deilvery network solutions inside the uni campus "or simply connect the diff parts of the uni in one delivery network "
3) reduce the cars crowed by deliver staff packages instead of the need of using the car to deliver them in-person
High:
1) a push to tech field industry in SA
2) decrease the 
3) decrease the need carbon emssion, by reducing the need of using the car to deliver between uni buildings

Deliverables : 
1) the delivery robot which will deliver the packages across the the uni campus

MileStones:
generate alter  
Evaluate the diff alter and choose the best 
buy the parts/order them
start working on techical design doc
term-1 rep
press term-1
implement the algorithms (the navigation & obstacle avoidnace)
test and validate the algorthims 
finish the artifact

risks :
team member quits   - find another, keep going
term ends sooner    -   fliexable shchdule sstart early 
lock-down reulting shipping isssues        -  find alter on local stores, order spare parts  or make our own prediction earlier
the security refuse testing and training the model on campus - formal letter from deanship 



problem statment : Create a single and comprehensive delivery network across the uni campus without human involve

missing responsiblity
